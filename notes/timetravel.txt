UNDOING CHANGES 
    AND 
TIME TRAVELING
==================

# NOTES FOR UNDOING CHANGES

git checkout <commit hash number>
    # this will move the head to a former
    commmit. Detached Head. Change branch to 
    go back. 
    *** You can then make a new branch at an old spot
        and work from that point forward without the 
        other commits that came after it. 

git checkout HEAD~1
    # This refers to commits that came before.
        so HEAD~1 is one commint before the current 
        position of head. HEAD~2 would be two
        positions before and so on.

git checkout HEAD <file name> or git checkout --<fileename>
    # to delete unstaged or non-commmited changes to a file.

git restore <file-name>
    # simular to above. goes back to previous commit.

git restore --staged <file-name>
    # unstage any files since previous commit.
