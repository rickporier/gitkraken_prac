Setting up Repository

# Best practice I have seen thus far.

1. Start on GitHub and make Repository
2. Clobe to Local
3. Link to GitKraken

Everything works better this way when compared to the
previous way I did it in git_practice. 

Adding notes to test merge with <new>

# VERY IMPORTANT
    Terminal will ask for a password at times but what 
    it is really looking for is a PAT or 
    Personal Access Token.

    PAT can be found under settings and then
    Developer Settings in GitHub.com.
